Hospital Management System Using Java
Introduction
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is an advanced Java project that leverages JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and PostgreSQL to create a comprehensive solution for managing hospital operations. This system automates the management of patient records, doctor appointments, medical staff schedules, billing, and other essential hospital functions. The objective is to enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and improve patient care through a robust and scalable software solution.

Key Features
Patient Management:

Registration and management of patient details.
Viewing and updating patient records.
Managing patient appointments and medical history.
Doctor Management:

Registration and management of doctor profiles.
Scheduling doctor appointments.
Tracking doctor availability and specialties.
Staff Management:

Managing hospital staff information.
Scheduling and tracking staff shifts.
Billing System:

Generating and managing patient bills.
Tracking payments and outstanding balances.
Medical Records Management:

Storing and retrieving patient medical records.
Ensuring secure access to sensitive medical information.
Reports and Analytics:

Generating reports on hospital operations.
Analyzing data for improving hospital efficiency.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for developing the application.
JDBC: Java Database Connectivity API for connecting and executing queries on the PostgreSQL database.
PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing all hospital-related data.
Swing: Java's GUI widget toolkit for creating the user interface.
Apache Maven: Project management and comprehension tool for managing project dependencies.
System Architecture
The system follows a layered architecture to ensure modularity and scalability:

Presentation Layer: Handles the user interface, built using Java Swing.
Business Logic Layer: Contains the core functionality and business rules.
Data Access Layer: Manages data interaction using JDBC.
Database Layer: PostgreSQL database where all data is stored.
